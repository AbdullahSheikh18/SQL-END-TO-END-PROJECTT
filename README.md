# SQL End-to-End Project

This repository contains my end-to-end SQL project where I demonstrate various SQL operations and queries that I applied to a sample dataset. The project covers key SQL concepts and operations like `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`, `JOIN`, `WHERE`, `HAVING`, and other advanced SQL techniques to extract meaningful insights from data.

## Project Overview

In this project, I worked with a database that includes various tables (e.g., **Customers**, **Orders**,  **Employees**, etc.). The primary goal was to build complex queries that help in real-world decision-making scenarios such as analyzing sales data, customer trends, and product performance.

The operations and queries performed in this project are as follows:
- **GROUP BY**: Aggregating data based on specific columns to get summarized insights like totals, averages, and counts.
- **ORDER BY**: Sorting the data to provide ranked or ordered results.
- **JOIN**: Combining multiple tables based on related columns to gain a comprehensive view of the data.
- **Data Manipulation**: Inserting, updating, and deleting data in tables.

## Database Schema

The project involves the following tables:

1. **Customers**: Stores customer information like name, contact, address, etc.
2. **Orders**: Contains order details such as order ID, customer ID, order date, and total value.
5. **Employees**: Contains employee data, such as employee ID, name, and role

## Features & Highlights:
- **Data Analysis**: Analyzing sales data by product, customer, and employee performance.
- **Advanced SQL Functions**: Utilized `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`, `HAVING`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `COUNT`, and more.
- **Optimized Queries**: Crafted efficient queries that can handle large datasets without performance degradation.
- **Comprehensive Reports**: Built queries that generate detailed reports on sales performance, customer demographics, etc.
- **Data Integrity**: Ensured that data remains consistent and accurate throughout the project using appropriate constraints and validation checks.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, you will need:
- **MySQL Server** installed and running.
- **SQL Client** such as MySQL Workbench, DBeaver, or any other MySQL-compatible client.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AbdullahSHEIKH18/sql-end-to-end-project.git
   ```

2. Import the SQL schema and sample data into your MySQL server.

3. Run the SQL queries on your preferred SQL client.

4. Customize the queries and modify the schema as per your requirements.
